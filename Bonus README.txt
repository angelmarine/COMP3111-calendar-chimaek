Weekly Appointment Data Visualization System

We have implemented a data visualization system to show each user's pattern of schedule according to weekday.
The frequency of appointments is shown in a form of circle - thus the radius of the circle is proportional to the number of appointments.
By this feature, we can see which day the user is busy and can compare among users. This will help user to see which day is overloaded and distribute his appointments accordingly.

We used Graphic 2D library in Java Swing to implement this feature.  

We have brainstormed the idea and architecture together, and the implementation is done by Jihyok Kim.
